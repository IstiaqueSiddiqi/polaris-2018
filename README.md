Polaris 2018
=============
Creating a scaffolding for full stack React with TypeScript (striving to put everything in TS), Apollo, GraphQL, Jest, Express, React Router and make them all work cohesively

### Vision
This is a work in progress. Idea is to treat this as scaffolding for future projects.
It will also be a learning of all these technologies in React Ecosystem.

### Technologies to be incorporated
* [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript (Both on client and server side)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [PostCSS for CSS](https://postcss.org/)
* [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Jest (React Testing)](https://jestjs.io/en/)
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* Testing for Express (not sure which framework to use)
